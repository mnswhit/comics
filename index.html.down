Sorry for the inconvenience, The Scripts that pull the comics got deleted, and the backups are old. I will have to re-create the scripts to pull the comics, hope to have something functional by Monday. If you have any questions, e-mail me at <a href=mailto:mark@whitacres.net>mark@whitacres.net</a><br>

Again, sorry for the inconvenience. <br>
